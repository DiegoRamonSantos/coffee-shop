## **About**

This project is a fictional web page for a coffee shop, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although it is a simple project, it was created with the intent of serving as a solid foundation for larger future projects. The central idea is to present a functional and visually appealing structure, with features that resemble a real coffee shop page.

## **Features**

The page is organized into five main sections:

- **About:** A brief introduction to the coffee shop.
- **Products:** Display of the products offered.
- **Review:** Customer reviews.
- **Contact:** Contact information.
- **Blogs:** Articles and posts related to the coffee shop.

## **Navigation**

All sections are accessible through a navigation menu located in the header, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Please note that the icons and items in the shopping cart are illustrative and currently do not have interactive functionalities. Future updates may add functionalities, such as adding or removing an item from the cart, for example.

## **Development**

The technologies used in this project include:

- **HTML5:** Semantic structuring of the page.
- **CSS3:** Styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript:** Basic interactivity of the page.
